# vue-dark-chocolate
A truffle box that comes with everything you need to start using smart contracts from a Vue App, with Bootstrap styling and components. Supporting frameworks include Vuex, Vue-Router & Bootstrap 4 (via Vue-Bootstrap) and webpack. The sample uses webpack-dev-server for hot-reloading or you can build and serve from an express server. 

This box has a simplistic smart contract model for registering/tracking trades between two accounts written in Solidity. The basic idea is that a vendor account registers the trade and the counterparty account has to certify it. The logic is implemented in the smart contracts to support the full trade flow but the frontend is not fully wired-up. A good exercise is to finish wiring up the frontend to go through the entire flow of registering a trade and having the counterparty certify. This provides a complete view of reading and writing to smart contracts from a dApp via truffle and web3 APIs. The sample also uses a few web3 utility methods that demonstrate how you can convert between strings/hex values from the frontend JavaScript all the way through to Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

This has only been tested on Windows but _should_ work just as well on Linux _(said no one ever)_. Restart-TestRpcInstance.ps1 is the only real Windows specific item, unless you have [PowerShell on Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/blog/powershell-is-open-sourced-and-is-available-on-linux/). That said, it just stops/starts a testrpc instance with defaults geared towards easily running this box so should be fairly easy to adapt.

To help reduce the learning curve to get started with Ethereum Blockchain and Truffle suite this sample includes some test data (in the form of testrpc accounts) and data seeding for smart contracts. To get started, you'll need to load the accounts in to Metamask. Check out testrpc-sample.md and use Metamask to import the HD Wallet mnemonic.

## Usage

To initialize a project with this example, run `truffle init vue-dark-chocolate` inside an empty directory.

## Building and running smart contract unit tests
1. Start an rpc instance `Restart-TestRpcInstance.ps1 -networkID: 27666` (27666 is the ID of the network which is used at unit test time to skip data seeding, see truffle.js config)
1. Run `truffle compile`
1. Then run `truffle test --network development-no-data-seed` to deploy and test the contracts on the 'development-no-data-seed' network

Highly recommend checking out the [testing](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/testing) doc. At the very least, it's good to be aware of the CLEAN-ROOM ENVIRONMENT approach:
>CLEAN-ROOM ENVIRONMENT
>Truffle provides a clean room environment when running your test files. When running your tests against the TestRPC, Truffle will use the TestRPC's advanced snapshotting features to ensure your test files don't share state with each other. When running against other Ethereum clients like go-ethereum, Truffle will re-deploy all of your migrations at the beginning of every test file to ensure you have a fresh set of contracts to test against.

## Building and running (interact via truffle console)
1. Start an rpc instance `Restart-TestRpcInstance.ps1`
1. Then run `truffle compile`, then run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contracts onto your network of choice (default "development").
1. Then run `truffle console`
1. See `sample_console.md` which shows how you can interact with the contracts via the console
1. To exit `.exit`

## Building and running the frontend (hot-reloading)
1. Start an rpc instance `Restart-TestRpcInstance.ps1`
1. Then run `truffle compile`, then run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contracts onto your network of choice (default "development").
1. Then run `npm run dev` to build the app and serve it on http://localhost:8081 (with support for hot reloading)

## Building and running the frontend (express)
1. Start an rpc instance `Restart-TestRpcInstance.ps1`
1. Then run `truffle compile`, then run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contracts onto your network of choice (default "development").
1. Then run `npm run build` (see the output in the build folder)
1. Then run `npm start` to start the express server (serves the static content from the build folder)

## On migrations
In combination with smart contract design, how migrations work, and how you reference deployed contracts is fairly fundamental, so just wanted to callout these docs to accelerate your learning (hopefully).

>The Migrations contract stores (in last_completed_migration) a number that corresponds to the last applied "migration" script, found in the migrations folder. Deploying this Migrations contract is always the first such step anyway. The numbering convention is x_script_name.js, with x starting at 1. Your real-meat contracts would typically come in scripts starting at 2_....
>
>So, as this Migrations contract stores the number of the last deployment script applied, Truffle will not run those scripts again. On the other hand, in the future, your app may need to have a modified, or new, contract deployed. For that to happen, you create a new script with an increased number that describes the steps that need to take place. Then, again, after they have run once, they will not run again.
[what are truffle migrations on stackoverflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/8299/what-are-truffle-migrations)
That's right, they won't run again, ever, so make sure your contract is ready for the wild because once it's on the blockchain, it's there forever! You can't really pull it back and add a field like you might with a database table :)

> When compiling and running migrations on a specific network, contract artifacts will be saved and recorded for later use. 
> When your contract abstractions detect that you're Ethereum client is connected to a specific network, they'll use the contract artifacts associated that network to simplify app deployment.

## Possible upgrades
Upgrades welcome, just shoot through a pull request.

* Listen to events in the TradeRegister.sol and read historical events via web3 event/filter APIs
* Build and Release from VSTS to an Azure App Service [ETHEREUM DEVOPS WITH TRUFFLE, TESTRPC & VISUAL STUDIO TEAM SERVICES](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/ethereum-devops-truffle-testrpc-vsts) & [Ethereum DevOps with VSTS â€“ easier now with new Truffle installer + npx](https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2017/09/06/ethereum-devops-with-vsts-easier-now-with-new-truffle-installer-npx/)

## Common Errors
I did see some quirks when restarting testrpc instances and trying to connect from Metamask. Looks like it was also observed in this [stackoverflow]() too. The resolution is really just to forcibly reconnect to the rpc instance by reselecting in Metamask.
