# vue-dark-chocolate
A truffle box that comes with everything you need to start using smart contracts from a Vue app, includes Vuex, Vue-Router, Vue-Bootstrap and webpack so you can get straight in to it. The sample uses webpack-dev-server for hot-reloading or if you'd prefer to build there's also a simple express server.
